## Training Schedule

### Day 1: Strength & Movement Development
- Warm-up: 10-15 minutes of dynamic mobility focusing on sport-specific movement patterns
- Main workout: Lower initial volume with focus on technique development with emphasis on Compound movements with appropriate loading (70-90% 1RM)
  * Front squat: 4 sets of 6-8 reps, 2 min rest
  * Overhead pressing: 4 sets of 8-10 reps, 90 sec rest
  * Core stability: 3 sets of 30-45 seconds, 60 sec rest
- Technical focus: Sport-specific technique development
- Cool-down: 5-10 minutes of targeted mobility work

### Day 2: Sport-Specific Development
- Warm-up: Sport-specific activation drills targeting primary movers
- Main workout: Sport-specific skill development and Conditioning matched to sport demands
  * Technical drills: 4 sets of 5-8 reps, full recovery
  * Sport-specific movement patterns: 3 sets of 10-12 reps, 60 sec rest
- Energy system training: Sport-specific conditioning
- Technical focus: High emphasis on proper form and movement patterns
- Cool-down: Mobility exercises for injury prevention

### Day 3: Recovery & Supplementary Work
- Active recovery: 20-30 minutes of low-intensity activity
- Targeted work for injury prevention: Focus on common problem areas
  * Mobility work: 2-3 sets of 30-45 seconds per position
  * Corrective exercises: 2 sets of 10-12 reps, focus on quality
- Joint stability, mobility maintenance, and recovery optimization`,
          deep_senzu_research: `# Comprehensive ${frequency}-Day ${sportName} Training Plan for ${experience} - ${goal}

## ðŸ§  Scientific Needs Analysis Matrix

### Movement Pattern Intelligence
- **Biomechanical Analysis**: Sport-specific movement patterns with unique biomechanical demands.
- **Multi-Planar Motion**: Multi-joint coordination specific to the sport's technical requirements.
- **Force Production**: Force application varies based on the specific demands of the sport.
- **Range-of-Motion Requirements**: Optimal joint mobility thresholds for ${sportName} include technical efficiency factors specific to the sport's performance requirements.
