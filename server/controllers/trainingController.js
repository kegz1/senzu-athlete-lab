## Training Schedule

### Day 1: Strength Focus
- Warm-up: 10 minutes of light cardio
- Main workout: 3 sets of 10 reps for major muscle groups
- Cool-down: 5 minutes of stretching

### Day 2: Skill Development
- Warm-up: Sport-specific drills for 15 minutes
- Main workout: Technical practice for 30-45 minutes
- Cool-down: Mobility exercises for 10 minutes

### Day 3: Recovery
- Active recovery: 20-30 minutes of low-intensity activity
- Flexibility work: 15-20 minutes of stretching
- Mental training: 10 minutes of visualization

## Progression Plan
Increase intensity by 5-10% every 2 weeks as you adapt to the training load.

## Nutrition Tips
Stay hydrated and ensure adequate protein intake to support recovery.`;
  } else {
    return `# Comprehensive ${sportName} Training Plan for ${experience} - ${goal}

## Needs Analysis

### Movement Patterns
The primary movement patterns in ${sportName} include pushing, pulling, rotation, and lower body power development.

### Energy Systems
${sportName} primarily utilizes the ATP-CP system for explosive movements, with significant aerobic contribution for overall endurance.

### Injury Risk Assessment
Common injury sites include shoulders, lower back, and knees. Preventative exercises are included in this plan.

## Periodization Framework

### Macrocycle (12 weeks)
- Weeks 1-4: Foundation Phase

- Active recovery: Low-intensity movement on rest days

## Scientific Basis
This program is based on principles of progressive overload [Kraemer & Ratamess, 2004], periodization [Issurin, 2010], and sport-specific adaptation [Bompa & Buzzichelli, 2019].

## Implementation Guidelines
Track progress using the provided training log and adjust based on recovery markers and performance metrics.`;
