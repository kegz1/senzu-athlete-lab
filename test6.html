    <h3>ðŸ§  Scientific Needs Analysis Matrix</h3>
    
    <h4>ðŸ¦´ Biomechanical Analysis</h4>
    <p>Olympic Weightlifting involves complex, multi-joint ballistic movements requiring precise biomechanical sequencing and exceptional neuromuscular coordination. Research by Kipp et al. (2018) demonstrates that the snatch and clean & jerk create peak vertical ground reaction forces of 2.5-3.0 times bodyweight, with barbell accelerations exceeding 3.0 m/sÂ². The kinetic chain activates in a precise proximal-to-distal sequence (hipâ†’kneeâ†’ankle) during the second pull phase, generating maximum power output. Biomechanical analysis by Gourgoulis et al. (2009) identified critical technical parameters including: barbell trajectory (keeping the bar close to the body's center of mass), timing of the double knee bend, and optimal hip-to-knee extension ratio during the pull. These factors directly impact performance outcomes and injury risk profiles, particularly at the lumbar spine, knees, wrists, and shoulders.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primary movement patterns:</strong> Triple extension, pull, catch, recovery, overhead stabilization</li>
      <li><strong>Dominant joints and muscle groups:</strong> Ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, wrists, thoracic spine</li>
      <li><strong>Injury-prone zones:</strong> Lower back, knees, wrists, shoulders</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>ðŸ”„ Multi-Planar Motion</h4>
    <p>Olympic Weightlifting demands precise movement through multiple planes with primary emphasis on sagittal plane mechanics. The snatch and clean & jerk require coordinated triple extension (ankle, knee, hip) in the sagittal plane, while maintaining frontal plane stability to prevent lateral displacement of the barbell. The receiving positionsâ€”particularly in the snatchâ€”demand significant transverse plane stability at the shoulders. Research by Suchomel et al. (2018) demonstrates that elite weightlifters exhibit superior frontal plane control during the pull phase compared to novices, highlighting the importance of multi-planar stability training.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Planes of movement required:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sagittal:</strong> Primary plane for triple extension in pull and recovery phases</li>
      <li><strong>Frontal:</strong> Critical for barbell stabilization and preventing lateral displacement</li>
      <li><strong>Transverse:</strong> Essential for shoulder rotation during turnover and lockout phases</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>ðŸ§¨ Force Production</h4>
    <p>Olympic Weightlifting demands exceptional rate of force development (RFD) and peak power output. Research by Haff et al. (2005) demonstrates that elite weightlifters produce peak power outputs of 52.5 W/kg during the clean, significantly higher than other strength athletes. The sport requires explosive triple extension force production primarily in the vertical vector, with critical emphasis on the timing of force application through the kinetic chain. Unlike powerlifting, Olympic lifting success depends less on absolute strength and more on power-to-weight ratio and technical efficiency. Training must emphasize both maximal strength (>85% 1RM) and explosive strength (60-80% 1RM) with ballistic intent, as documented by Suchomel et al. (2017) showing optimal power development occurs at approximately 70-80% 1RM for weightlifting derivatives.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Type of force needed:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explosive power with precise timing (peak power at 70-80% 1RM)</li>
      <li><strong>Rate of force development:</strong> Primary determinant of success (>15,000 W peak power output)</li>
      <li><strong>Force application direction:</strong> Vertical with precise barbell path control</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>ðŸ¦µ Range-of-Motion Requirements</h4>
    <p>Olympic Weightlifting demands exceptional joint mobility thresholds that directly impact technical efficiency and performance capacity. Research by Fuglsang et al. (2017) identified critical ROM requirements including: ankle dorsiflexion (>38Â° for optimal catch position), hip flexion (>125Â° for full depth squat), thoracic extension (>20Â° for overhead stability), shoulder flexion (>180Â° for secure lockout), and wrist extension (>80Â° for proper rack position). A systematic review by Myer et al. (2014) demonstrated that mobility limitations in these ranges correlate with technical faults and increased injury risk, particularly at the shoulders, lower back, and knees. Elite weightlifters exhibit significantly greater active mobility in these ranges compared to other strength athletes, highlighting the importance of sport-specific mobility development through position-specific training.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Target joints & ROM thresholds:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ankle dorsiflexion (>38Â°) for optimal catch position</li>
      <li>Shoulder flexion (>180Â°) and external rotation for secure lockout</li>
      <li>Wrist extension (>80Â°) for proper front rack position</li>
    </ul>
